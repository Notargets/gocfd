Awesome CFD solver written in Go 

## An implementation of the Discontinuous Galerkin Method for solving systems of equations

### Credits to Jan S. Hesthaven and Tim Warburton for their excellent text "Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods" (2007)

### Objectives

1) Implement a complete 3D solver for unstructured CFD (and possibly MHD) using the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method
2) Optimize for GPUs and groups of GPUs, taking advantage of the nature of the natural parallelism of DG methods
3) Prove the accuracy of the CFD solver for predicting flows with turbulence, shear flows and strong temperature gradients
4) Make the solver available for use as an open source tool

It is important to me that the code implementing the solver be as simple as possible so that it can be further developed and extended. There are other projects that have achieved the above, most notably the [HiFiles](https://hifiles.stanford.edu/) project, which has demonstrated high accuracy for turbulence problems and some transonic flows with shock waves and is open source. I personally find that C++ code is very difficult to understand due to the heavy usage of indirection and abstraction, which makes an already complex subject unnecessarily more difficult. I feel that the Go language makes it easier to develop straightforward, more easily understandable code paths, while providing similar if not equivalent optimality and higher development efficiency than C++.  

### Why do this work?

I studied CFD in graduate school in 1987 and worked for Northrop for 10 years doing CFD to design and debug airplanes and propulsion systems. During my time applying CFD, I had some great success and some notable failures in getting useful results from the CFD analysis. The most common theme in the failures: flows with thermal gradients, shear flows and vortices were handled very poorly by all known usable Finite Volume methods.

Then, last year (2019), I noticed there were some amazing looking results appearing on Youtube and elsewhere showing well resolved turbulent eddies and shear flows using this new "Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Elements" method...

### Guide to code review

If you are interested in reviewing the physics and how it is implemented, look through the code in "model_problems". Each file there implements one physics model or an additional numerical method for a model.

If you want to look at the math / matrix library implementation, take a look at the code in utils/matrix_extended.go and utils/vector_extended.go. I've implemented a chained operator syntax for operations that favors reuse / reduces copying and makes clear the dimensionality of the operands. It is far from perfect and complete, especially WRT value assignment and indexing, as I built the library to emulate and implement what was in the text and matlab, however it is functional / useful. The syntax is somewhat like RPN (reverse polish notation) in that you manage an accumulation of value over chained operations.

For example, the following line implements:
```rhsE = - Dr * FluxH .* Rx ./ epsilon``` Dr is the "Derivative Matrix" and Rx is (1 / J), applying the transform of R to X, and epsilon is the metalic impedance, all applied to the Flux matrix:
```
	RHSE = el.Dr.Mul(FluxH).ElMul(el.Rx).ElDiv(c.Epsilon).Scale(-1)
```

### Updates (June 2, 2020): 

Implemented a smooth solution (Density Wave) in the Euler Equations DFR solver and ran convergence studies. The results show a couple of things:
1) Rapid convergence to machine zero across polynomial order and number of elements
2) Order of convergence is N, not the optimal (N+1)
3) Aliasing instability when using the Roe flux
4) The "SlopeMod" limiter destroys the accuracy of the smooth solution

While it was very nice to see (1) happen, the results of (2) made me take a harder look at the DFR approach implemented now. I had taken the "shortcut" of having set the flux at the element faces, and not modifying the interior flux values, which has the impact of converting the flux into a polynomial of order (N-2) due to the removal of the two faces from the order N basis by forcing their values. It seems that the resulting algorithm has a demonstrated order of (N-1) in convergence rate as a result.

One of the reasons I took the above shortcut is that right now we are using the "Legendre-Gauss-Lobato" (LGL) nodes for the algorithm, per Hesthaven, and the LGL points include the face vertices for each element, which makes it impossible to implement the Jameson DFR approach for DFR.

In the Jameson DFR, the Gauss quadrature points do not include the face vertices. The algorithm sets the flux values at the face vertices, then performs an interpolation across the combination of interior and face (N+1+2) vertices to determine the coefficients of the interior flux polynomial such that the new polynomial passes through all (N+1) interior points in the element and the two face vertices. The resulting flux polynomial is of formal order (N) and resides on the same (N+1) interior points as the solution.

The Jameson DFR algorithm provides an equivalent, but simpler and more efficient (15% faster) way to achieve all of the benefits of DG methods. The DFR solver uses the differential form of the target equations, rather than the integral form, which makes it easier to attack more complex combinations of target equations. DFR has also been extended by Jameson, et al to incorporate spectral methods with entropy stable properties.

### Updates (May 26, 2020): Verified DFR and Roe Flux after fixing the Exact solution to the Sod shock tube
#### Resolved DFR/Roe solution compared to exact at T = 0.2, N=3, 2000 Elements
![](images/EulerDFR-K2000-N3-fixedRoe.PNG)

A highly resolved solution from the DFR/Roe solver looks qualitatively good without bumps or other instability artifacts. The contact discontinuity is in the right place and very sharply resolved.

#### Comparison of DFR/Roe and Galerkin/Lax at T = 0.2, N=2, 200 Elements
DFR Roe (fixed flux) | Galerkin Lax
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](images/eulerDFR-K200-N2-fixedRoe.PNG) | ![](images/eulerGK-K200-N2.PNG)

I removed a term that was present in the 3D version of the flux that doesn't make sense in 1D, and now the contact discontinuity is in the right place and the bump is gone.

Now, when we compare the DFR Roe flux (left) to the Galerkin Lax flux (right), we can see the Roe solution has a steeper contact discontinuity and shock, as we would expect. Both solutions get the locations correctly.

I also optimized some of the DFR code and timed each solution. Surprisingly, the DFR/Roe is slightly faster than the Galerkin/Lax.

#### T = 0.2, N=3, 2000 Elements
DFR Roe (broken flux) | Galerkin Lax
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![](images/EulerDFR-K2000-N3.PNG) | ![](images/EulerGK-K2000-N3.PNG)

DFR/Roe versus Galerkin/Lax: In the DFR solution the contact discontinuity is steeper than the GK/Lax solution. There is a very slight position error for the contact discontinuity in the DFR solution and also a bump on the left side of it, an artifact of the underdamped aliasing.

#### T = 0.2, N=3, Galerkin Lax Flux, 500 Elements
![](images/EulerGKRho1-fixed.PNG)

The shock speed problem I saw yesterday turns out to have been the exact solution :-)

After correcting the exact solution to Sod's shock tube problem, the two Euler solvers match up pretty well all around, with some small differences between them - phew!

### Update (May 25, 2020): Roe Flux with DFR - Euler 1D compared to Analytic Solution in real time
#### T = 0.223, N=4, Roe Flux, 600 Elements
![](images/EulerDFRRho1.PNG)

This is cool - being able to see exactly the errors and successes in realtime. The above is a snap of an interim result where I'm now showing the exact solution in symbols overlaying the simulation in realtime and sure enough we see a shock speed error on the leading shock wave, along with excellent reproduction of the smooth expansion flow.

I also went back and checked the Galerkin (non-DFR) Euler case and it has the same error in shock propagation speed as the DFR/Roe result, which says there's a common error somewhere. It's good to spend time doing basic accuracy tests!

You can recreate this using ``` gocfd -graph -model 5 -CFL 0.75 -N 4 -K 600```

### Update (May 12, 2020): DFR and Aliasing, Instability and Fixing it
On the path to implementing direct flux reconstruction, I found what appeared to be 2nd order aliasing without a clear origin. After consulting Hesthaven(2007) section 5.3, I see that the issue is the interpolation of the flux and subsequently taking the derivative of that interpolated flux. As stated: "the derivative of the interpolation is not the same as the interpolation of the derivative", or put another way, by simply computing the flux from the nodal points of the solution polynomial, we are not treating the flux formally as a polynomial - instead we should perform a formal polynomial fit (projection, instead of interpolation) of the flux prior to using that polynomial to compute derivatives of the flux. The result of using interpolation shown in the text is that we produce an aliasing error into the solution, and their answer is to filter it away instead of using the much more compute intensive projection. The aliasing error also gets worse with increasing N, so the filter should change with N.

I've implemented a simple 2nd order dissipative filter with a constant coefficient, which works well to knock out the oscillations without introducing solution error. I also experimented with a combined 2nd / 4th order filter, similar to what is commonly used in finite volume schemes and for this problem the 2nd order dissipation was enough. However, I can not get stable results beyond about N=6 with this filter, so I'll also investigate an efficient way to do projection and/or improved filters.

--> prior updates
DFR for Maxwell's equations now uses 2nd order artificial dissipation to remove the odd/even aliasing and it works pretty well, which affirms my earlier finding of higher order modes. Next steps might include doing a stability analysis on the DFR scheme, covering the details of the reconstruction. It is slightly different than in Jameson(2014), in that this formulation of NDG uses N+1 points for the polynomials, including the node edges. In Jameson(2014), they extended the flux points to N+3 to cover the element edges, where here I just formed the fluxes at the face points, which are at i=1 and i=N+1. 

You can see it as model 4 with default parameters like ```gocfd -model 4 -graph``` The issue is the instability - it scales with N, so is a higher order modal signal - It could be that the Lax Friedrich's flux, which is 1st order, is not providing damping of the higher order modes. But why are there higher order modes? Are these unresolved waves? I can't answer without more looking into it...

### Current Status (May 9, 2020): Direct Flux Reconstruction implemented for 1D Advection, moving to implement for the other two 1D model problems

DFR works for Advection (-model 3) and seems to improve accuracy and physicality.

The primary differences between using DFR and traditional Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin:
1) Instead of using only the primitive variables in the right hand side, we use the Flux directly for a hyperbolic problem
2) The flux is a globally composed variable and is differentiated after being "reconstructed" to be C(0)
3) The reconstruction technique follows Jameson(2014) in that we coerce the flux values of each face to be consistent values at each face, then use the same Np Gauss-Lobato nodes and metrics to develop the derivative(s) of flux

For (3) in this case, I used the same Lax-Friedrichs flux calculation from the text, then averaged the values from each side of each face together to make a single consistent face value shared by neighboring elements.

### (May 1, 2020): Researching Direct Flux Reconstruction methods
During testing of the method in 1D as outlined in the text, it became clear that the slope limiter is quite crude and is degrading the physicality of the solution. The authors were clear that this is just for example use, and now I'm convinced of it!

My first round of research yielded the [Direct Flux Reconstruction](research/filters_and_flux_limiters/Romero2015.pdf) technique from a 2014 paper by Antony Jameson, et al (one of my favorite CFD people of all time). The technique is extremely simple and has the great promise of extending the degree of accuracy to the Flux terms of more complex equations, in addition to enabling the use of flux limiters that have been proven for flows with discontinuities.

In my past CFD experience, discontinuities in solving the Navier Stokes equations are not limited to shock waves. Rather, we find shear flows have discontinuities that are similar enough to shock waves that shock finding techniques used to guide the application of numerical diffusion can be active at the edge of boundary layers and at other critical regions, which often leads to inaccuracies far from shocks. The text's gradient based limiter would clearly suffer from this kind of problem among others.

### Model Problem Example #3a: Euler's Equations in 1D - Shock Collision

This is an interesting problem because of the temperature remainder after the collision. In the plot, temperature is red, density is blue, and velocity is orange. After the shocks pass out of the domain, the remaining temperature "bubble" can't dissipate, because the Euler equations have no mechanism for temperature diffusion.

This case is obtained by initializing the tube as with the Sod tube, but leaving the exit boundary at the left side values (In == Out). This produces a left running shock wave that meets with the shock moving right.

### Model Problem Example #3: Euler's Equations in 1D - Sod's shock tube

The 1D Euler equations are solved with boundary and initial conditions for the Sod shock tube problem. There is an analytic solution for this case and it is widely used to test shock capturing ability of a solver.

Run the example with graphics like this:
```
bash# make
bash# gocfd -model 2 -graph -K 250 -N 1
```

You can also target a final time for the simulation using the "-FinalTime" flag. You will have to use CTRL-C to exit the simulation when it arrives at the target time. This leaves the plot on screen so you can screen cap it.
```
bash# gocfd -model 2 -graph -K 250 -N 1 -FinalTime 0.2
```

### Model Problem Example #2: Maxwell's Equations solved in a 1D Cavity

The Maxwell equations are solved in a 1D metal cavity with a change of material half way through the domain. The initial condition is a sine wave for the E (electric) field in the left half of the domain, and zero for E and H everywhere else. The E field is zero on the boundary (face flux out = face flux in) and the H field passes through unchanged (face flux zero), corresponding to a metallic boundary.



Run the example with graphics like this:
```
bash# make
bash# gocfd -model 1 -delay 0 -graph -K 80 -N 5
```

Unlike the advection equation model problem, this solver does have unstable points in the space of K (element count) and N (polynomial degree). So far, it appears that the polynomial degree must be >= 5 for stability, otherwise aliasing occurs, where even/odd modes are excited among grid points.

In the example pictured, there are 80 elements (K=80) and the element polynomial degree is 5 (N=5).
