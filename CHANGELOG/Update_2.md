## Update: Model Problem Example #2: Maxwell's Equations solved in a 1D Cavity

The Maxwell equations are solved in a 1D metal cavity with a change of material half way through the domain. The initial condition is a sine wave for the E (electric) field in the left half of the domain, and zero for E and H everywhere else. The E field is zero on the boundary (face flux out = face flux in) and the H field passes through unchanged (face flux zero), corresponding to a metallic boundary.



Run the example with graphics like this:
```
bash# make
bash# gocfd -model 1 -delay 0 -graph -K 80 -N 5
```

Unlike the advection equation model problem, this solver does have unstable points in the space of K (element count) and N (polynomial degree). So far, it appears that the polynomial degree must be >= 5 for stability, otherwise aliasing occurs, where even/odd modes are excited among grid points.

In the example pictured, there are 80 elements (K=80) and the element polynomial degree is 5 (N=5).
