### Update: Aug 20 2020):
I finally have a working Raviart-Thomas element at any K up to 7th order now. The limitation to 7th order is a matter of finding optimized point distributions for this element type. This RT element closely follows the approach described in [Romero and Jameson](https://github.com/Notargets/gocfd/blob/master/research/convergence_and_fluxes/DFR/romero_jsc_2017.pdf) for the 3rd and 4th orders, and uses the point distributions from [Williams and Shun](https://github.com/Notargets/gocfd/blob/master/research/convergence_and_fluxes/DFR/williams-shun-jameson-quadrature.pdf) for orders 1,2 and 5-7. The RT vector basis cooefficients for order N are solved numerically in one matrix inversion, yielding a full polynomial basis with (N+1)(N+3) terms implemented as degrees of freedom defining the basis distributed on the [-1,-1] reference triangle. There are 3(N+1) points on the faces of the triangle, and N(N+1)/2 points defining the interior, and each of the interior points hosts 2 degrees of freedom, one for each orthogonal basis vector [r,s] = [1,0] and [0,1], the axis vectos for r and s. The zero order (N=0) element has 0 interior points and 3 face points, one on each face, the N=1 element has 2 points on each face and 1 point in the interior, the N=2 has 9 points on faces (3 per edge), and 3 interior points, for a total of (2+1)(2+3)=15 degrees of freedom.

The Raviart-Thomas elements at orders 1 and 7 are shown above, with basis vectors as green lines. On the left is RT1, showing a single interior point with two basis vectors. The RT7 element has 28 interior points, each with two basis vectors. The edges of RT7 each have 8 points, each with a single normal vector for the basis.

Here is the cool part: the number of interior points within each of the above elements matches that of the Lagrange element used for the Nodal Galerkin models(!) That means we can have a Nodal Galerkin element at order N=1, which has (N+1)(N+2)/2 = 3 points inside it have a companion RT_2 element that also has 3 interior points. This makes it possible to represent gradient, curl, and divergence of our scalar variables residing inside the Nodal Galerkin elements in the RT_N+1 elements, where those fields are calculated using the two dimensional polynomial basis in a vector preserving way. All this without interpolating between the Lagrangian element and the RT element - the point locations are shared between them, which removes a major source of error and complication. 

I'm still implementing tests, but the basics are finally there. Next step: implement gradient, divergence, curl operators and test for convergence to known solutions to [ sin(y), sin(x) ]. After that, I'll need to implement the calculation of the coordinate transform Jacobian, which actually follows from the previous operators in that the calculation of [ J ] includes the same derivatives used in the gradient.
