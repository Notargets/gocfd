### Update: Model Problem Example #3a: Euler's Equations in 1D - Shock Collision

This is an interesting problem because of the temperature remainder after the collision. In the plot, temperature is red, density is blue, and velocity is orange. After the shocks pass out of the domain, the remaining temperature "bubble" can't dissipate, because the Euler equations have no mechanism for temperature diffusion.

This case is obtained by initializing the tube as with the Sod tube, but leaving the exit boundary at the left side values (In == Out). This produces a left running shock wave that meets with the shock moving right.
