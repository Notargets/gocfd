# Question

Should we use point distributions that include faces, edges and vertices 
like Hesthaven?

## Prompt1

Hesthaven and Warburton include face, edge and vertex points in their 3D 
element work. I'm building a 3D CFD and MHD solver and want to embark in 
the right direction for success. I like their idea in that we can minimize 
the interpolation errors normally encountered  when extrapolating interior 
polynomials to the face for the Riemann problem solution, but are there 
other complicating factors that make inclusion of the face, edge and vertex 
points impractical for compressible CFD with LES and iLES solvers? What 
about hex, prism and pyramid (especially) elements where the basis is 
different? How have others handled the inclusion of the top vertex of a 
pyramid element? Get me the experience of other researchers WRT inclusion 
of face, edge and vertex node points in a nodal DG context for solving CFD 
with shocks and iLES.

## Prompt2

In response to:
```
I'll help you research the practical considerations of including face, edge,
 and vertex points in 3D nodal DG methods  for compressible CFD. Let me 
 clarify a few things to ensure I get you the most relevant information:

Are you particularly interested in high-order methods (p > 3), or are you 
considering lower-order implementations as well?
For the pyramid elements, are you planning to use modal or nodal basis 
functions, and are you considering collapsed coordinate approaches or 
tensor-product bases?

Are you primarily focused on explicit time-stepping schemes, or are you 
also considering implicit methods where the face/edge/vertex points might 
affect the conditioning?
```

Since I'm doing iLES, I'm expecting to use elements of orders up to 5 of a 
mixture of types including tet, hex (primarily), prism and pyramid 
(unfortunately necessary for boundary layer meshes as a transition element).
I will use nodal basis functions like PKD for tets, tensor basis for hex, 
mixed tensor/PKD for prism and collapsed for pyramid. Explicit methods are 
my expectation, though I may need to resort to implicit and need to 
understand if my choice here impacts that option. Definitely planning on p 
multigrid, maybe p+h multigrid.

# Practical experiences with nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods for compressible CFD

The integration of face, edge, and vertex nodes in 3D nodal discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) methods represents a critical design choice that profoundly
impacts computational efficiency, numerical stability, and shock-capturing
capabilities. Recent advances by leading research groups reveal both
significant opportunities and persistent challenges in implementing these
high-order methods for compressible flow simulations with implicit large eddy
simulation (iLES).

## Revolutionary approaches beyond traditional nodal distributions

The conventional wisdom established by Hesthaven and Warburton's foundational
work—using closed nodal distributions with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) points
on all element boundaries—faces competition from innovative alternatives. **Pan
and Persson's half-closed node approach (2024)** demonstrates that placing nodes
on only a subset of element boundaries yields identical sparsity patterns for
the Laplace operator while improving computational efficiency. This breakthrough
leverages Gauss-Radau points for quadrilateral and hexahedral elements,
achieving enhanced operator assembly performance through superconvergence
properties.

The entropy-stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM)
developed by Kopriva, Gassner, and colleagues offers another compelling
alternative. By exploiting the diagonal-norm summation-by-parts (SBP) property
with LGL quadrature, this approach provides **provable entropy stability** for
compressible Navier-Stokes equations—crucial for under-resolved turbulent
simulations. The FLUXO code implementation demonstrates enhanced robustness
compared to traditional approaches, particularly for challenging flow
configurations.

Research groups report computational overhead of 20-40% when including face,
edge, and vertex nodes compared to interior-only formulations. However, this
cost brings substantial benefits: enhanced inter-element coupling critical for
compressible flows, more accurate boundary condition enforcement, and superior
geometric flexibility for complex configurations. The MIT group's compact
discontinuous Galerkin (CDG) method reduces matrix non-zeros through specialized
flux formulations, achieving 40-60x GPU speedups through optimized memory access
patterns.

## Pyramid elements challenge conventional wisdom

Mixed element meshes containing tetrahedra, hexahedra, prisms, and pyramids
present unique implementation challenges, with **pyramid elements posing the
greatest difficulty** due to their apex singularity. Bergot's revolutionary 2010
work proved that traditional polynomial basis functions cannot exist for pyramid
geometries while maintaining conformity—necessitating non-polynomial rational
basis functions using Jacobi polynomials.

The collapsed coordinate singularity at pyramid apices creates severe challenges
for nodal DG implementations. Research groups have developed four primary
mitigation strategies: rational shape functions following Bergot's method,
semi-nodal high-order bases for straight-edged pyramids, weight-adjusted
approximations for efficient mass matrix inversion, and composite element
strategies subdividing pyramids into tetrahedral sub-elements. Recent
summation-by-parts framework extensions to tensor-product operators in collapsed
coordinates enable provably stable discretizations while resolving time step
limitations from coordinate singularities.

Practical experiences from Remacle and Geuzaine's group at University of Liège
demonstrate that pyramid elements perform comparably to tetrahedral elements in
convergence studies, though not matching pure hexahedral performance. The
critical finding: pyramid transitions enable efficient hex-dominant meshing
strategies that would otherwise be impossible for complex geometries. However,
standard row-summation lumping can produce negative masses at apex vertices,
requiring careful treatment in production implementations.

## Shock capturing demands strategic nodal placement

The inclusion of face, edge, and vertex nodes profoundly impacts shock-capturing
capabilities and numerical stability. Persson and Peraire's subcell
shock-capturing framework, which switches between high-order DG and lower-order
dissipative schemes based on modal energy decay rates, benefits significantly
from LGL nodes that include face points. These provide **direct inter-element
coupling** essential for detecting shocks near element boundaries—a known
limitation of interior-only approaches.

Gassner's entropy-stable subcell shock-capturing method leverages the LGL nodal
structure to seamlessly blend high-order DG with first-order finite volume
methods while maintaining provable entropy stability. The key insight: face
nodes enable consistent information transfer between DG and finite volume
representations, crucial for maintaining stability across the blending
transition. Research consistently shows LGL discretizations provide superior
stability properties through the SBP property emerging from collocating
quadrature and interpolation points.

For implicit large eddy simulation, nodal distribution directly affects
intrinsic filter properties and subgrid scale modeling. Moura, Mengaldo, and
Sherwin's work reveals that LGL nodes provide controlled dissipation through
Riemann solver upwinding at faces—the primary dissipation mechanism replacing
explicit SGS models. At moderate Reynolds numbers, this implicit dissipation
suffices, but high Reynolds number flows require careful tuning or hybrid
approaches. The nodal distribution fundamentally controls energy transfer from
resolved to unresolved scales, making face node inclusion critical for iLES
stability at higher Reynolds numbers.

## Conditioning challenges plague implicit methods

Classical interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin methods suffer severe
conditioning degradation when face, edge, and vertex nodes are present,
particularly with local variations in mesh size, polynomial degree, or diffusion
coefficients. Dong and Georgoulis developed the Robust IPDG (RIPDG) method to
address these issues through carefully constructed weighted averages of gradient
approximations, achieving **order-of-magnitude conditioning improvements** for
challenging configurations.

Persson and Peraire's comprehensive studies on implicit time integration reveal
that existing preconditioners—block Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and basic multilevel
schemes—lack robustness for low Mach numbers, stretched grids, or high Reynolds
number turbulent flows. Newton-GMRES solvers with sophisticated multigrid
preconditioning emerge as the most efficient and robust algorithms, though
implementation complexity remains high.

Stiller's polynomial multigrid methods for nodal interior penalty formulations
on 3D Cartesian grids demonstrate remarkable efficiency through weighted
overlapping Schwarz smoothers operating on element-centered subdomains. Residual
reductions of two orders of magnitude within single V(1,1) cycles prove
achievable, with robustness maintained up to polynomial order 32. The critical
finding: overlapping Schwarz smoothers with element-centered subdomains
effectively handle the complex coupling patterns created by face, edge, and
vertex nodes.

## Production codes reveal performance reality

Major production DG frameworks—PyFR (Imperial College), Nektar++ (
Imperial/Utah), and FLEXI (Stuttgart)—provide crucial insights into real-world
performance trade-offs. PyFR achieves 50x performance improvements over the past
decade, scaling to 2,048 NVIDIA GH200 GPUs with approximately 90% strong scaling
efficiency. The framework's cross-platform approach through domain-specific
languages enables deployment across diverse architectures while maintaining
performance.

FLEXI demonstrates scaling to 500,000+ CPU cores for production runs, supporting
polynomial orders beyond 20 through efficient DGSEM implementation. The GALÆXI
GPU variant uses CUDA Fortran for accelerated performance. Nektar++ provides a
unified framework supporting both continuous and discontinuous Galerkin
formulations, with comprehensive solver collections for various flow regimes and
strong emphasis on numerical stability through spectral vanishing viscosity.

Memory usage comparisons reveal 15-30% overhead for face/edge/vertex node
implementations compared to element-only approaches, though high-order
implementations (p>4) demonstrate superior memory efficiency per degree of
accuracy. The **optimal performance sweet spot** emerges at polynomial orders
3-5 for most applications, balancing computational cost against accuracy gains.
GPU implementations consistently show 10-100x speedups over CPU implementations,
with multi-GPU scaling efficiency reaching 85-95% in production codes.

## Multigrid methods adapt to nodal complexity

P-multigrid and p+h multigrid methods face unique challenges when face, edge,
and vertex nodes create complex coupling patterns affecting smoother efficiency.
Fidkowski's p-multigrid development with line Jacobi smoothing achieves
convergence rates independent of interpolation order but weakly dependent on
grid size. The key finding: higher order proves advantageous over grid
refinement when high accuracy is required, with close to ideal coarse-grain
scalability for parallel implementations.

Recent advances incorporate hierarchical scale separation methods for better
scale decoupling and combine p-multigrid with algebraic multigrid techniques for
complex 3D domains. Partial smoothing techniques, updating only subsets of
unknowns at each p-multigrid scale, show promise for modal DG discretizations.
Line smoothers prove particularly effective for stretched grids common in
viscous flow simulations, while overlapping Schwarz approaches handle the
increased coupling from boundary nodes.

## Conclusions shape future implementations

The research reveals a mature but rapidly evolving field where careful
implementation choices profoundly impact performance and robustness. Face, edge,
and vertex nodes increase computational cost but provide essential benefits for
shock capturing, geometric flexibility, and numerical stability. The
Hesthaven-Warburton approach remains foundational, but innovative alternatives
like half-closed nodes and entropy-stable formulations offer compelling
advantages for specific applications.

Pyramid element handling through Bergot-type rational basis functions has become
standard practice, though apex singularities require ongoing attention. For
shock-dominated flows, LGL schemes with entropy-stable formulations provide
superior robustness, while iLES applications benefit from the implicit
dissipation mechanisms enabled by face nodes. Conditioning challenges persist
for implicit methods, but sophisticated multigrid strategies and robust
formulations offer practical solutions.

Production codes demonstrate that high-order DG methods are approaching
industrial maturity, with 10-50x speedups possible compared to traditional
methods for equivalent accuracy. The optimal configuration emerges as polynomial
orders 3-5 with carefully designed nodal distributions, entropy-stable
formulations for challenging flows, and GPU acceleration for maximum
performance. Success requires balancing theoretical rigor with practical
engineering considerations, leveraging the collective experience of the global
CFD research community.
