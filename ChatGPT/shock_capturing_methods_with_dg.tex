What is the most successful method for capturing shock waves in the Euler equations for high order discontinuous galerkin finite elements methods?
============================================

Capturing shock waves in the Euler equations for high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods is a challenging task because of the need to balance high accuracy in smooth regions with stability near discontinuities. The most successful methods typically combine **shock capturing mechanisms** with **limiting techniques** or **artificial viscosity**. Here are the most common and successful approaches:

### 1. **Slope Limiters**
   - **Minmod, Barth-Jespersen, or WENO-based Limiters**: These are applied to the solution to limit oscillations near discontinuities.
   - Limiters are designed to maintain the high-order accuracy of the DG method in smooth regions while suppressing spurious oscillations (Gibbs phenomena) near shocks.
   - **Positivity-preserving limiters** are sometimes used to ensure physically realistic results, such as maintaining non-negative density and pressure.

### 2. **Modal or Hierarchical Slope Limiting**
   - This approach involves limiting the coefficients of the basis functions in the DG representation (e.g., modal coefficients) to reduce oscillations.
   - **TVB (Total Variation Bounded) limiting** is an example that adapts the limiting process based on solution smoothness.

### 3. **Artificial Viscosity**
   - Artificial viscosity methods introduce a localized, solution-adaptive viscosity term to the Euler equations near discontinuities.
   - The viscosity is added dynamically based on indicators such as the gradient or higher-order derivatives of the solution.
   - Key techniques:
     - **Persson-Taylor artificial viscosity**: Uses a spectral smoothness indicator to detect shocks and add viscosity adaptively.
     - **Entropy-based viscosity**: Introduces viscosity where entropy production indicates non-physical oscillations.

### 4. **Subcell Resolution Techniques**
   - Introduce lower-order methods (e.g., finite volume schemes) within cells containing shocks to stabilize the solution, while retaining high-order DG methods elsewhere.
   - Example: **Subcell finite volume reconstruction** or hybrid DG/finite-volume approaches.

### 5. **Shock Sensors**
   - Shock sensors detect the presence of discontinuities and trigger additional stabilization or limiting mechanisms.
   - Popular shock sensors include:
     - **Modal decay sensors**: Analyze the decay of modal coefficients to identify shocks.
     - **Density jump indicators**: Use jumps in conserved variables or their gradients.

### 6. **Hybrid Weighted Approaches**
   - Combine DG with Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes to achieve robustness near shocks and high-order accuracy in smooth regions.
   - WENO reconstruction provides a way to compute numerical fluxes in a stable and accurate manner.

### 7. **Entropy-Stable Schemes**
   - Modify the DG formulation to ensure entropy stability, which naturally controls oscillations near shocks.
   - These schemes often use entropy-conserving fluxes and add dissipation terms in a controlled manner.

### Comparison of Methods
- **Slope Limiters** are straightforward and computationally efficient but can degrade accuracy in smooth regions.
- **Artificial Viscosity** provides a more flexible and smooth transition between regions but may require careful tuning of parameters.
- **Subcell Resolution** methods offer robustness but are computationally expensive.
- **Shock Sensors** allow selective application of limiting or viscosity, minimizing the impact on smooth regions.

### Current Best Practices
- A **hybrid approach** combining **shock sensors** and **adaptive artificial viscosity** is often most effective for high-order DG methods. For instance:
  - Use a **modal decay shock sensor** to identify shocks.
  - Apply **artificial viscosity or a limiter** only in detected regions.
  - Employ **entropy-stable fluxes** to ensure physical consistency.

By combining these techniques, high-order DG methods can achieve both accuracy and stability for problems with shock waves in the Euler equations.

============================================
Limiters will “buzz”, bouncing a shock location between neighbor cells and making it impossible to converge a solution. What is the most successful technique to eliminate the buzzing phenomenon of a limiter?
============================================

The "buzzing" phenomenon in limiters occurs because traditional limiters can interact with the shock in a way that destabilizes its position, causing it to oscillate between neighboring cells. This can prevent convergence, especially in steady-state problems. The most successful techniques to eliminate this buzzing effect focus on **shock detection, localized stabilization, and preserving a balance between limiting and smooth transitions**. Here are the key approaches:

---

### 1. **Smooth Transition Limiters**
- Replace sharp limiters with smooth, differentiable limiters to reduce oscillatory feedback near the shock.
- Examples:
  - **WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) Limiters**: Smoothly blend solutions from different stencils and reduce oscillations at cell interfaces.
  - **Hermite WENO (HWENO)**: Extends WENO to provide more precise, smooth solutions with high-order accuracy.
- Smooth limiters reduce the sharp corrections that contribute to shock buzzing.

---

### 2. **Shock-Tracking or Interface-Capturing**
- Instead of relying solely on limiters, employ **shock-tracking techniques** that explicitly locate the shock and stabilize it.
- Methods:
  - **Moving-mesh techniques**: Align the mesh with the shock to eliminate artificial oscillations.
  - **Level-set methods**: Track the shock as an interface and apply stabilization directly to its location.

---

### 3. **Entropy-Stable Limiters**
- Use **entropy-stable flux formulations** that inherently suppress non-physical oscillations without introducing sharp corrections.
- These methods maintain stability and reduce artifacts near shocks, preventing feedback that causes buzzing.

---

### 4. **Non-Oscillatory Discretization at the Shock**
- Replace the high-order DG representation near the shock with a low-order scheme (such as finite volume) to handle the discontinuity more robustly.
- Examples:
  - **Hybrid DG-Finite Volume Methods**: Transition from high-order DG to a more dissipative scheme at the shock.
  - **Subcell Resolution Techniques**: Use fine-grained resolution within each cell to handle discontinuities directly.

---

### 5. **Localized Artificial Viscosity**
- Add adaptive artificial viscosity to stabilize the shock without influencing smooth regions of the solution.
- Key feature: Artificial viscosity should only act in the immediate vicinity of the shock, determined by a **shock sensor**.
- Popular models:
  - **Persson-Taylor artificial viscosity**: Uses modal decay to determine the location and magnitude of viscosity.
  - **Entropy-based viscosity**: Introduces dissipation proportional to the local entropy generation.

---

### 6. **Relaxation-Based Limiters**
- Use **relaxation-based limiting schemes** that stabilize shocks without introducing abrupt corrections:
  - Gradually apply the limiting effect over several iterations, reducing shock oscillation artifacts.
  - Example: **Targeted ENO (TENO) schemes**, which progressively enforce smoothness based on local features.

---

### 7. **Steady-State Convergence Enhancement**
- To address convergence specifically:
  - Use **pseudo-time stepping** methods to smoothly converge to the steady state without inducing oscillations.
  - Apply **residual-based limiting**: Adjust the limiting strength based on the residuals in the steady-state equations, suppressing oscillations as the solution converges.

---

### 8. **Shock Position Fixing**
- Explicitly fix the shock position after its location has been determined:
  - **Shock-fitting techniques**: Modify the solver to align the shock location with a specific interface or cell boundary, stabilizing its position.

---

### 9. **Flow-Aligned Basis Functions**
- Instead of standard polynomial basis functions, use basis functions aligned with the flow features (e.g., **anisotropic basis functions**). These better capture shocks and reduce oscillatory behavior without requiring aggressive limiting.

---

### Recommendations
The most successful approach to eliminate buzzing involves a combination of **adaptive artificial viscosity** and **entropy-stable schemes**. This method avoids aggressive limiting that could destabilize the shock position while smoothly stabilizing discontinuities. 

A practical hybrid strategy:
1. Use a **shock sensor** (e.g., modal decay or entropy indicators) to detect shocks.
2. Apply **adaptive artificial viscosity** in shock regions.
3. Ensure convergence by adopting **relaxation-based limiters** or **pseudo-time stepping**.

These techniques, used together, effectively stabilize the shock location and ensure solution convergence.

Woodward and Colella implemented schemes that captured strong shock waves, describe their method and associated methods that captured strong shocks, like those in fusion generating plasmas
============================================

The **Woodward and Colella method**, introduced in their seminal 1984 paper, was designed to capture strong shock waves in compressible fluid dynamics, such as those encountered in fusion-generating plasmas. Their method is based on **high-resolution shock-capturing schemes**, particularly the use of **Godunov-type methods** combined with **piecewise parabolic reconstruction** to achieve high accuracy in smooth regions and stability near discontinuities.

Here is a detailed breakdown of their method and related techniques for capturing strong shocks:

---

### **Woodward and Colella's Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM)**

     - The method relies on **approximate Riemann solvers** (e.g., HLLC or Roe solvers) to compute fluxes at cell interfaces.
   - **Shock Flattening**:
     - Near strong shocks, the scheme adaptively reduces to a more robust, low-order representation to prevent spurious oscillations.
   - **Contact Discontinuity Steepening**:
     - The method introduces steepening algorithms for contact discontinuities, ensuring sharp transitions without excessive numerical dissipation.

3. **Applications**:
   - The PPM was designed to handle strong shocks, contact discontinuities, and other discontinuous phenomena. It has been widely used in simulations of supernova explosions, inertial confinement fusion (ICF), and other high-energy plasma applications.

---

### **Related Methods for Capturing Strong Shocks**

1. **Godunov-Type Methods**
   - **Godunov’s First-Order Method**: A robust, shock-capturing scheme that solves the Riemann problem exactly at each cell interface. It is highly dissipative but forms the basis for more advanced methods like PPM.
   - Higher-order Godunov schemes use reconstruction techniques (e.g., PPM or WENO) to improve accuracy in smooth regions while retaining stability near shocks.

2. **Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) Schemes**
   - WENO methods extend the Godunov framework by using a weighted average of high-order stencils to reconstruct the solution.
   - They adaptively select smooth stencils, avoiding oscillations near shocks while maintaining high-order accuracy elsewhere.
   - **Advantages in Plasma Simulations**:
     - They are particularly effective for problems with complex shock structures, such as those in magnetic confinement fusion or shock-induced plasma compression.

3. **High-Resolution Shock-Capturing (HRSC) Schemes**
   - HRSC methods, such as the **Total Variation Diminishing (TVD)** and **ENO (Essentially Non-Oscillatory)** schemes, focus on preserving sharp shock transitions while avoiding spurious oscillations.
   - They introduce non-linear limiters (e.g., minmod, superbee) to control oscillations without excessive smearing of shocks.

4. **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)**
   - AMR techniques dynamically refine the computational grid near strong shocks or steep gradients, ensuring sufficient resolution without excessive computational cost.
   - This approach is often combined with PPM or WENO methods for large-scale simulations.

5. **Artificial Viscosity and Stabilization Techniques**
   - For extreme shock capturing, **localized artificial viscosity** is often added to stabilize the solution. 
   - **Entropy-based viscosity** is particularly effective in fusion plasma simulations, where shock-capturing schemes must preserve physical entropy conditions.

6. **Hybrid Schemes**
   - Hybrid schemes combine low-order shock-capturing methods (e.g., finite volume) near discontinuities with high-order methods (e.g., DG or finite elements) in smooth regions.
   - Example: Hybrid **DG-WENO schemes** for plasma physics applications.

---

### **Applications in Fusion-Generating Plasmas**
1. **Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF)**:
   - Simulations of laser-driven implosions require capturing strong shocks and rarefactions in a compressible plasma.
   - PPM and WENO methods have been extensively used due to their ability to resolve steep gradients and track interfaces between materials.

2. **Magnetized Plasma Dynamics**:
   - Strong shocks and magnetic field interactions in magnetic confinement fusion are modeled using **MHD extensions** of the Euler equations.
   - Shock-capturing schemes like PPM and HRSC have been adapted for MHD with appropriate flux-splitting techniques.

3. **Astrophysical Plasma**:
   - Supernovae and accretion disk simulations involve strong shocks in ionized plasmas. PPM remains a gold standard for these applications.

---

### **Why PPM and Its Variants Are Successful**
- **High-order accuracy** in smooth regions ensures that small-scale features are resolved, which is crucial in plasma simulations.
- **Shock-capturing robustness** ensures that strong shocks, contact discontinuities, and other steep gradients are handled without oscillations.
- **Adaptability**: Techniques like shock flattening and contact discontinuity steepening allow PPM to handle extreme conditions without degrading accuracy.

These characteristics make PPM and related methods like WENO and HRSC the preferred choice for modeling strong shocks in high-energy plasma simulations.


============================================
Is PPM used in any popular unstructured simplex mesh methods
============================================
The **Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM)** was originally developed for structured grids and Cartesian meshes, where its reconstruction and flux computations are straightforward to implement. However, adapting PPM to **unstructured simplex meshes** (e.g., triangular or tetrahedral meshes) is more complex due to the geometric irregularities and the need for accurate reconstruction and flux integration over arbitrarily shaped cells. While PPM itself is not directly used in most unstructured simplex mesh methods, **ideas from PPM** have been incorporated into modern high-order methods for unstructured meshes. These include **reconstruction techniques**, **limiting strategies**, and **shock-capturing mechanisms**.

### **Adaptations and Alternatives for Unstructured Meshes**

1. **Piecewise Polynomial Reconstructions in Unstructured Grids**
   - The concept of using high-order piecewise polynomial reconstructions, like the parabolic reconstruction in PPM, has been adapted for unstructured meshes:
     - Methods such as **Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO)** or **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)** methods on unstructured meshes use similar high-order reconstruction techniques.
     - These methods construct polynomials over each simplex (triangle or tetrahedron) using local neighboring information, akin to PPM's reconstruction philosophy.

2. **Reconstruction-Based Finite Volume Schemes**
   - Some finite volume methods on unstructured grids use **piecewise parabolic reconstruction** to achieve higher-order accuracy:
     - The polynomial reconstruction is performed using least-squares or gradient-based techniques over neighboring cells.
     - These methods combine PPM-like ideas with flux computation using Riemann solvers at arbitrary cell interfaces.
   - Example: Unstructured finite volume methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes like **OpenFOAM** use similar reconstruction techniques.

3. **High-Order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Methods**
   - **DG methods** naturally extend PPM-like ideas to unstructured meshes:
     - In DG, the solution within each cell is represented by high-order basis functions, often polynomials of degree ≥2 (including parabolic).
     - This representation captures the high-order accuracy of PPM, while shock-capturing is handled using **limiters** or **artificial viscosity**.
   - DG methods on simplicial meshes (triangles or tetrahedra) are widely used for problems involving shocks, turbulence, and plasmas.

4. **Piecewise Parabolic Boltzmann Methods**
   - In some contexts, **Boltzmann-based approaches** combine PPM ideas with finite volume techniques on unstructured grids.
   - These methods often incorporate PPM's parabolic reconstruction for moments or fluxes.

5. **Finite Element Volume Schemes**
   - Hybrid methods like **Finite Volume Element (FVE)** methods use high-order reconstructions, inspired by PPM, within unstructured simplex grids.
   - The reconstructions are adapted to the geometry of the simplices using barycentric coordinates or shape functions.

6. **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) on Unstructured Grids**
   - Unstructured AMR frameworks sometimes use PPM-like techniques locally on refined patches to achieve high resolution in regions with shocks.

---

### **Challenges of PPM on Unstructured Meshes**
- **Reconstruction Complexity**: The parabolic reconstruction in PPM requires a regular stencil of neighbors, which is straightforward in structured grids but challenging in unstructured meshes.
- **Geometric Variability**: On unstructured meshes, cells have arbitrary shapes, making it harder to compute gradients and reconstruct polynomials consistently.
- **Flux Integration**: PPM relies on efficient flux computations at cell interfaces, which are more computationally expensive and geometrically complex on unstructured meshes.

---

### **Popular Alternatives Inspired by PPM**
Instead of directly implementing PPM, many high-order schemes inspired by its principles are used on unstructured simplex meshes:

1. **WENO Schemes**:
   - Extend the high-resolution reconstruction of PPM to unstructured grids using weighted polynomial reconstructions.

2. **High-Order DG Methods**:
   - Achieve PPM's accuracy by representing solutions as high-order polynomials in each simplex.

3. **Residual Distribution Schemes**:
   - Use high-order reconstructions and flux-based residual distribution to achieve accuracy on unstructured meshes.

4. **Spectral Volume and Spectral Difference Methods**:
   - These methods are designed for unstructured grids and achieve high-order accuracy, making them suitable for shock-capturing applications.

---

### **Applications**
While PPM itself is not widely used on unstructured simplex meshes, its principles of high-order polynomial reconstruction and robust shock-capturing have influenced many **modern methods**. These methods are used in:
- **Plasma simulations** (e.g., magnetic confinement fusion, inertial confinement fusion)
- **Astrophysics** (e.g., supernova simulations)
- **Compressible CFD** (e.g., hypersonic flows)

In these contexts, **DG methods**, **WENO schemes**, and **adaptive hybrid approaches** provide the best combination of PPM-inspired accuracy and flexibility on unstructured meshes.

============================================
When interpolating flux within a simplex to the interface of a neighbor cell in a discontinuous galerkin method, using the polynomial basis of the cell to obtain the value on the near side of the face often causes large oscillations in values. How is this handled in current successful implementations?
============================================
When interpolating flux within a simplex to the interface of a neighboring cell in **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods**, oscillations can occur near discontinuities due to the high-order nature of the polynomial basis. These oscillations, often linked to the **Gibbs phenomenon**, are exacerbated in the presence of shocks or steep gradients. Modern successful implementations handle this problem using a combination of **stabilization techniques**, **limiting strategies**, and **improved reconstruction methods**. Below are the key approaches:

---

### 1. **Slope Limiting and Flux Limiting**
   - **Slope limiters** or **flux limiters** reduce the oscillations at interfaces by constraining the polynomial representation of the solution near discontinuities.
   - Common techniques:
     - **TVB (Total Variation Bounded) limiter**: Applies a smooth, localized correction to the polynomial coefficients while preserving high-order accuracy in smooth regions.
     - **WENO-based limiters**: Adaptively reconstruct the solution or flux near the face using stencils that avoid discontinuities.
     - **Bounded reconstruction**: Ensures that values stay within physically admissible bounds (e.g., non-negative density).

   - **Face-based limiters**: Apply limiters specifically at the cell interfaces to directly reduce the oscillations in the interpolated flux.

---

### 2. **Artificial Viscosity**
   - Artificial viscosity introduces a small dissipative term to smooth out oscillations near the interface without affecting the overall high-order accuracy.
   - **Shock sensors** (e.g., based on gradients, entropy production, or modal coefficients) detect regions where artificial viscosity should be applied.
   - Popular methods:
     - **Persson-Taylor artificial viscosity**: Uses a spectral smoothness indicator to determine where and how much viscosity to apply.
     - **Entropy-based viscosity**: Adds dissipation proportional to the entropy gradient to stabilize the solution.

---

### 3. **Flux Reconstruction and Riemann Solvers**
   - The **numerical flux** at the interface is computed using approximate **Riemann solvers** (e.g., Roe, HLL, or HLLC solvers). These solvers naturally introduce dissipation at discontinuities.
   - **Improved reconstruction methods**:
     - Use subcell or **hybrid reconstruction techniques** (e.g., combining DG with finite volume methods) near the interface.
     - Employ **central fluxes** in smooth regions and dissipative fluxes near shocks, determined by a shock sensor.

---

### 4. **Subcell Resolution and Hybrid Methods**
   - **Subcell resolution techniques** reduce oscillations by switching to lower-order methods (e.g., finite volume) within cells containing strong gradients or shocks.
   - Hybrid approaches:
     - **DG-Finite Volume**: Use DG for smooth regions and finite volume methods at discontinuities.
     - **DG-WENO Hybrid**: Blend DG with WENO reconstruction to handle steep gradients.

---

### 5. **Interface-Specific Polynomial Modification**
   - Modify the polynomial basis functions near the interface to better represent steep gradients without overshooting:
     - **Moment-based limiting**: Limit the modal coefficients of the polynomial expansion to smooth out oscillations near the interface.
     - **Orthogonal polynomial filtering**: Suppress higher-order modes selectively to reduce oscillations.

---

### 6. **Entropy-Stable DG Schemes**
   - Modify the DG formulation to ensure **entropy stability**, which naturally prevents unphysical oscillations near discontinuities.
   - Entropy-conserving or entropy-stable flux functions enforce physical constraints at the interface.

---

### 7. **Face-Averaged Flux or Reconstruction**
   - Instead of directly interpolating fluxes using the polynomial basis, compute **face-averaged fluxes**:
     - Integrate the flux over the face using Gaussian quadrature, ensuring smoother transitions.
     - This reduces the sensitivity to local oscillations in the high-order basis.

---

### 8. **Shock Detection and Adaptation**
   - Use a **shock sensor** to detect discontinuities and adaptively modify the interpolation or limiting strategy near the interface.
   - Popular shock sensors:
     - **Modal decay sensor**: Detects oscillations by analyzing the decay rate of the polynomial coefficients.
     - **Gradient-based sensors**: Identify steep gradients in the solution.

---

### 9. **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)**
   - Refine the mesh adaptively near discontinuities to better resolve steep gradients, reducing the need for aggressive limiting or dissipation.

---

### 10. **Targeted ENO (TENO) Schemes**
   - Use **TENO reconstruction** at interfaces, which blends polynomials from neighboring cells in a non-oscillatory manner. This method provides sharp transitions and avoids oscillations.

---

### Recommended Practice for Successful Implementations
A **hybrid strategy** is typically most effective:
1. **Shock detection**: Use a smoothness or shock sensor to identify problematic regions near interfaces.
2. **Adaptive limiting**: Apply a limiter or artificial viscosity only in detected regions to minimize the impact on smooth areas.
3. **Flux computation**: Use a robust Riemann solver to compute stable fluxes at the interface.
4. **High-order integration**: Use face-averaged or quadrature-based flux integration to reduce oscillations.

By combining these techniques, modern DG methods on unstructured simplex meshes effectively handle large oscillations in flux interpolation at interfaces.

============================================
The problem with modal limiting is that for small order like P=2, you still get large oscillations in the interpolated values and truncating or modifying the highest mode is all that is available as there are only 2, which doesn’t allow for smooth or powerful enough corrections.
============================================

You're absolutely right that **modal limiting** becomes ineffective for low-order polynomial spaces, such as \( P = 2 \), because there are insufficient modes to apply a nuanced correction. Truncating or modifying just the highest mode can result in inadequate control of oscillations and poor shock resolution. Modern approaches to address this issue focus on combining **better reconstruction strategies**, **face-specific treatments**, and **hybrid methods** to achieve more robust stabilization. Here are alternative and successful strategies tailored to this limitation:

---

### 1. **Subcell Limiting (Subcell Finite Volume Hybridization)**
   - **Subcell Resolution**: Decompose each element into subcells (e.g., small finite volume cells within the simplex) and apply limiting or shock-capturing techniques at the subcell level.
   - Instead of modifying the modal basis, compute a **subcell solution** and then reconstruct a consistent high-order representation.
   - This method allows for finer corrections and avoids the constraints imposed by the small number of modes in \( P = 2 \).
   - **Examples**:
     - **Finite Volume-DG Hybrid**: Use finite volume reconstruction within the cell while retaining DG methods for smooth regions.
     - **Subcell WENO reconstruction**: Reconstruct fluxes on subcell stencils using WENO methods.

---

### 2. **Nodal Limiting (Vertex-Based Slope Limiting)**
   - Use **nodal basis functions** or vertex-based corrections instead of modal coefficients.
   - Limit the values of the solution or flux directly at the nodes (or quadrature points) of the element.
   - By operating in physical space rather than modal space, this approach offers more direct control of oscillations at low orders.
   - **Advantages**:
     - Works effectively for \( P = 2 \) because it does not rely on truncating modes.
     - Avoids the global effect of modifying modal coefficients.

---

### 3. **Gradient-Based Slope Limiting**
   - Compute the **gradient of the solution** within the cell and limit it to reduce oscillations at the interface.
   - Example: **Barth-Jespersen Limiter**, which modifies the polynomial solution to enforce monotonicity at the cell boundaries.
   - By controlling gradients directly, this method avoids the reliance on the number of modes and provides smoother transitions.

---

### 4. **Nonlinear Shock Capturing with Artificial Viscosity**
   - Introduce a **nonlinear artificial viscosity** term that adapts to the solution's gradients or shock indicators.
   - For low-order polynomial spaces, this provides a smooth, localized dissipation mechanism to stabilize the flux without excessive smearing.
   - Example: **Persson-Taylor artificial viscosity**, which adds dissipation proportional to a smoothness indicator based on the polynomial expansion.

---

### 5. **Polynomial Decomposition with Entropy Filtering**
   - Split the polynomial solution into a smooth part and a discontinuous part, and apply selective damping to the discontinuous component.
   - For \( P = 2 \), this method involves modifying the highest mode while using entropy constraints to ensure physical consistency.
   - **Entropy filtering** avoids large oscillations by suppressing unphysical entropy production.

---

### 6. **Hybrid Reconstruction with Neighbor Stencils**
   - Use information from neighboring cells to enhance the reconstruction at the face.
   - Examples:
     - **WENO Reconstruction**: Blend polynomial reconstructions from multiple stencils to avoid oscillations.
     - **TENO (Targeted ENO)**: Focus on stencils that minimize oscillations while preserving accuracy.

---

### 7. **Flux Projection Techniques**
   - Instead of interpolating the polynomial to the face directly, project the flux onto a **low-order representation** (e.g., constant or linear) specifically for flux evaluation.
   - This reduces oscillations caused by high-order interpolations near discontinuities.
   - The resulting flux is still consistent with the DG framework but avoids relying entirely on \( P = 2 \) interpolation.

---

### 8. **Shock-Fitting and Interface Tracking**
   - For extreme cases, explicitly fit the shock interface to align it with the cell faces. This eliminates the need for interpolation across discontinuities, removing oscillations entirely.
   - This method is computationally expensive but highly effective for strong shocks.

---

### 9. **Face-Averaged Limiting**
   - Instead of limiting the polynomial coefficients or nodal values directly, **limit the flux or solution averaged over the cell face**:
     - Compute the flux integral over the face using quadrature points.
     - Apply limiting to these averaged values, ensuring smooth transitions across faces.

---

### 10. **Regularization of the Limiter**
   - Use **regularized limiters** that apply smooth, differentiable corrections rather than sharp truncations:
     - Example: **Kuzmin limiter** or **Hierarchical Basis limiter**, which provides smoother control even for low-order cases.
     - These methods prevent oscillations by regularizing the limiting process without overly reducing the polynomial order.

---

### Practical Recommendations
Given the constraints of \( P = 2 \), a combination of the following is often most effective:
1. **Nodal or gradient-based limiting**: Focus on limiting values or gradients directly rather than modal coefficients.
2. **Subcell resolution**: Incorporate finer resolution inside cells using hybrid finite volume or subcell WENO techniques.
3. **Artificial viscosity**: Apply localized dissipation in regions of steep gradients or shocks.
4. **Flux-based strategies**: Use face-averaged or projected fluxes for stability at interfaces.

These approaches mitigate the limitations of low-order modal limiting and ensure robust performance in the presence of strong shocks or steep gradients.

============================================
How does projection work in a galerkin element? I am confused about the term projection, as it seems to involve an integral process to arrive at the lower order representation.
============================================

The term **projection** in the context of a Galerkin element refers to the mathematical process of approximating a function (e.g., a solution or a flux) onto a finite-dimensional space spanned by the basis functions of the element. This process typically involves **integrals** to compute the coefficients of the basis functions, ensuring the approximation is optimal in some sense (e.g., minimizing error in the chosen norm). Let’s break this down:

---

### **1. What is Projection?**
In Galerkin methods, projection means **representing a function in terms of the basis functions** used within an element. If the basis functions are \(\{\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_N\}\), and the function to be approximated is \(f(x)\), the projection seeks a representation:

\[
f_h(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{f}_i \phi_i(x),
\]

where \(\{\hat{f}_i\}\) are the coefficients of the projection (the "weights" of the basis functions).

---

### **2. How is the Projection Computed?**
To determine the coefficients \(\hat{f}_i\), the Galerkin projection requires that \(f_h(x)\) satisfy the following **orthogonality condition**:

\[
\int_\Omega \left(f(x) - f_h(x)\right) \phi_i(x) \, dx = 0 \quad \text{for all } i = 1, \dots, N,
\]

where:
- \(\Omega\) is the domain of the element.
- \(f(x) - f_h(x)\) is the approximation error.

This ensures that the residual (error) is orthogonal to the basis functions, minimizing the approximation error in the \(L^2\)-norm (the square-integrable norm).

---

### **3. Integral Representation**
Expanding \(f_h(x)\) into its basis function form:

\[
\int_\Omega \left(f(x) - \sum_{j=1}^N \hat{f}_j \phi_j(x)\right) \phi_i(x) \, dx = 0.
\]

Simplifying this, the coefficients \(\{\hat{f}_j\}\) are determined by solving:

\[
\int_\Omega f(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx = \sum_{j=1}^N \hat{f}_j \int_\Omega \phi_j(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx.
\]

In matrix form, this can be written as:

\[
M \hat{f} = F,
\]

where:
- \(M_{ij} = \int_\Omega \phi_i(x) \phi_j(x) \, dx\) is the **mass matrix** (or projection matrix),
- \(F_i = \int_\Omega f(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx\) are the **right-hand side integrals**.

---

### **4. Lower-Order Projection**
When projecting a higher-order polynomial \(f(x)\) onto a **lower-order subspace**, the process is the same, but the basis functions \(\{\phi_i(x)\}\) now correspond to a reduced set representing the lower-order space. The integrals effectively "smooth out" the higher-order components, leaving only the part of \(f(x)\) that lies in the lower-order space.

For example:
- If \(f(x)\) is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2), projecting it onto a linear basis (degree 1) retains only the linear part of \(f(x)\), discarding the higher-order terms.

This smoothing effect is one reason why projection is used near shocks or discontinuities to stabilize oscillations.

---

### **5. Key Properties of Projection**
- **Optimality**: The projection minimizes the approximation error in the chosen norm (typically \(L^2\)).
- **Filtering**: Higher-order components are filtered out when projecting onto a lower-order space.
- **Integral Process**: The integrals compute how the function aligns with the basis functions, ensuring the approximation is accurate within the space spanned by the basis.

---

### **6. Practical Implementation**
In numerical methods:
- The integrals are typically computed using **numerical quadrature** (e.g., Gaussian quadrature).
- The projection may involve solving a small linear system if the mass matrix \(M\) is not diagonal.

For example, in **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods**:
- To project a flux onto the element basis, compute:
  \[
  \hat{f}_i = \frac{\int_\Omega f(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx}{\int_\Omega \phi_i(x) \phi_i(x) \, dx},
  \]
  assuming the basis functions are orthogonal.

---

### **7. Why Does Projection Help in Flux Stabilization?**
- **Smooth Transition**: Projection reduces high-order oscillations by averaging the solution or flux in a way that respects the basis functions.
- **Reduced Complexity**: By projecting onto a lower-order space, the flux representation becomes less sensitive to high-order oscillations.
- **Stabilization**: Near discontinuities, projection avoids overfitting by smoothing out the flux in a mathematically consistent way.

---

### Example: Flux Projection
If \(f(x)\) is a flux computed on a high-order basis, and we want a stable representation at a face, we project it onto a linear (or constant) basis:

1. Compute the integrals of \(f(x)\) with respect to the lower-order basis functions.
2. Reconstruct the flux on the face using only the coefficients of the lower-order basis.

This projection reduces oscillations while preserving the essential features of the flux.

---

### Summary
Projection in Galerkin methods involves:
1. Representing the function in terms of the basis functions.
2. Computing coefficients using integrals that ensure orthogonality.
3. Filtering out high-order components when projecting to a lower-order space.

This process provides a mathematically consistent way to stabilize and approximate solutions in DG methods, particularly near interfaces or discontinuities.

============================================
Provide an example of projection from p=2 to p=1 in a simplex in matrix form.
============================================

Let's work through an example of projecting a solution from a **\( P=2 \)** (quadratic polynomial) space to a **\( P=1 \)** (linear polynomial) space on a simplex (e.g., a triangular element in 2D).

---

### **Setup**

1. **Polynomial Basis**:
   - For \( P=2 \) on a 2D simplex, the basis functions might be:
     \[
     \phi_1(x, y) = 1, \quad \phi_2(x, y) = x, \quad \phi_3(x, y) = y, \quad \phi_4(x, y) = x^2, \quad \phi_5(x, y) = xy, \quad \phi_6(x, y) = y^2.
     \]
   - For \( P=1 \) on the same simplex, the basis functions are:
     \[
     \psi_1(x, y) = 1, \quad \psi_2(x, y) = x, \quad \psi_3(x, y) = y.
     \]

2. **Solution Representation**:
   - The solution \( u(x, y) \) in the \( P=2 \) space is:
     \[
     u^{P=2}(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^6 \hat{u}_i \phi_i(x, y),
     \]
     where \(\hat{u}_i\) are the coefficients in the \( P=2 \) basis.
   - We want to approximate \( u(x, y) \) in the \( P=1 \) space:
     \[
     u^{P=1}(x, y) = \sum_{j=1}^3 \tilde{u}_j \psi_j(x, y),
     \]
     where \(\tilde{u}_j\) are the coefficients in the \( P=1 \) basis.

3. **Projection Requirement**:
   - The projection ensures that the \( L^2 \)-norm of the error is minimized:
     \[
     \int_\text{simplex} \left( u^{P=2}(x, y) - u^{P=1}(x, y) \right) \psi_j(x, y) \, dx\,dy = 0 \quad \text{for } j = 1, 2, 3.
     \]

---

### **Matrix Formulation**

We derive the projection by solving:

\[
M \tilde{u} = F,
\]

where:
- \( M \) is the **mass matrix** for the \( P=1 \) basis.
- \( F \) is the **projection vector** containing integrals of the \( P=2 \) basis functions with the \( P=1 \) basis functions.

---

1. **Mass Matrix (\( M \))**:
   - The mass matrix for the \( P=1 \) basis is:
     \[
     M_{jk} = \int_\text{simplex} \psi_j(x, y) \psi_k(x, y) \, dx\,dy.
     \]

2. **Projection Vector (\( F \))**:
   - The projection vector relates the \( P=2 \) and \( P=1 \) bases:
     \[
     F_j = \int_\text{simplex} u^{P=2}(x, y) \psi_j(x, y) \, dx\,dy = \int_\text{simplex} \left( \sum_{i=1}^6 \hat{u}_i \phi_i(x, y) \right) \psi_j(x, y) \, dx\,dy.
     \]

   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     F_j = \sum_{i=1}^6 \hat{u}_i \int_\text{simplex} \phi_i(x, y) \psi_j(x, y) \, dx\,dy.
     \]

   - Let \( P_{ji} = \int_\text{simplex} \phi_i(x, y) \psi_j(x, y) \, dx\,dy \). Then:
     \[
     F_j = \sum_{i=1}^6 P_{ji} \hat{u}_i.
     \]

3. **Linear System**:
   - Substituting into the matrix form:
     \[
     M \tilde{u} = P \hat{u}.
     \]
   - Here:
     - \( M \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3} \): \( P=1 \) mass matrix.
     - \( P \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 6} \): Projection matrix between \( P=2 \) and \( P=1 \).
     - \( \hat{u} \in \mathbb{R}^6 \): Coefficients in the \( P=2 \) basis.
     - \( \tilde{u} \in \mathbb{R}^3 \): Coefficients in the \( P=1 \) basis.

---

### **Example on a Simplex**

Consider a simplex with vertices at \((0,0)\), \((1,0)\), and \((0,1)\). The basis functions and integrals are computed over this domain.

1. **Basis Functions**:
   - \( P=2 \): \(\phi_1 = 1\), \(\phi_2 = x\), \(\phi_3 = y\), \(\phi_4 = x^2\), \(\phi_5 = xy\), \(\phi_6 = y^2\).
   - \( P=1 \): \(\psi_1 = 1\), \(\psi_2 = x\), \(\psi_3 = y\).

2. **Mass Matrix (\( M \))**:
   - For \( P=1 \), the integrals are:
     \[
     M_{11} = \int_\text{simplex} 1 \cdot 1 \, dx\,dy, \quad M_{12} = \int_\text{simplex} 1 \cdot x \, dx\,dy, \quad \dots
     \]

   - On this simplex:
     \[
     M = \frac{1}{24} \begin{bmatrix}
     2 & 1 & 1 \\
     1 & 2 & 1 \\
     1 & 1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]

3. **Projection Matrix (\( P \))**:
   - Compute each entry \( P_{ji} = \int_\text{simplex} \phi_i(x, y) \psi_j(x, y) \, dx\,dy \).

4. **Linear System**:
   - Solve \( M \tilde{u} = P \hat{u} \) for \(\tilde{u}\), giving the \( P=1 \) coefficients.

---

### **Conclusion**

This process ensures that the \( P=1 \) solution is the optimal projection of the \( P=2 \) solution in the \( L^2 \)-sense. While the exact values of the integrals depend on the simplex geometry, the steps above outline how projection is handled in matrix form.


============================================
Why is the Vandermonde matrix used in interpolation, when the sum of coefficients times basis functions could be used instead?
============================================
The **Vandermonde matrix** is used in interpolation to provide a systematic way to determine the coefficients of a polynomial representation when values are given at specific points (e.g., nodal values). While the sum of coefficients times basis functions is the ultimate representation of the interpolating polynomial, the **Vandermonde matrix** plays a critical role in constructing this representation efficiently and in converting between representations. Here’s why it is commonly used:

---

### **1. The Role of the Vandermonde Matrix**

The Vandermonde matrix arises when we seek to construct a polynomial interpolant \( p(x) \) that matches given data points \((x_i, f_i)\), where \( f_i \) are the function values at the interpolation points \( x_i \). The interpolant is expressed as:

\[
p(x) = \sum_{j=0}^N c_j \phi_j(x),
\]

where \( \{\phi_j(x)\} \) are the basis functions (e.g., monomials, Lagrange polynomials, or orthogonal polynomials), and \( \{c_j\} \) are the unknown coefficients to be determined.

The interpolation condition is:

\[
p(x_i) = f_i, \quad \text{for } i = 0, 1, \dots, N.
\]

This leads to the linear system:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\phi_0(x_0) & \phi_1(x_0) & \cdots & \phi_N(x_0) \\
\phi_0(x_1) & \phi_1(x_1) & \cdots & \phi_N(x_1) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\phi_0(x_N) & \phi_1(x_N) & \cdots & \phi_N(x_N)
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c_0 \\
c_1 \\
\vdots \\
c_N
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
f_0 \\
f_1 \\
\vdots \\
f_N
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The coefficient matrix here is the **Vandermonde matrix**, denoted \( V \), with entries:

\[
V_{ij} = \phi_j(x_i).
\]

---

### **2. Why Use the Vandermonde Matrix?**

The Vandermonde matrix provides a way to systematically solve for the coefficients in terms of the function values. This is especially useful in practice for the following reasons:

#### (a) **Efficient and Systematic Construction**
- The Vandermonde matrix is a structured matrix that directly encodes the relationship between the polynomial basis and the nodal values.
- It provides a clear path to solving for the coefficients \( \{c_j\} \), ensuring the interpolating polynomial satisfies the given data.

#### (b) **Basis Independence**
- By constructing the Vandermonde matrix, the method works regardless of the choice of polynomial basis \( \{\phi_j(x)\} \), whether monomials \( \{1, x, x^2, \dots\} \), Lagrange basis functions, or orthogonal polynomials.
- This flexibility is particularly important in numerical methods like finite elements or spectral methods, where different bases may be used.

#### (c) **Explicit Connection to Nodal Values**
- In some bases (e.g., monomials), the coefficients \( \{c_j\} \) do not directly correspond to function values at the nodes \( \{f_i\} \). The Vandermonde matrix bridges this gap by mapping between these representations.

#### (d) **Linear System Representation**
- The Vandermonde matrix turns the interpolation problem into a standard linear algebra problem. Once \( V \) is constructed, solving \( Vc = f \) yields the coefficients directly.

---

### **3. Why Not Directly Use the Basis Functions?**

While the representation \( p(x) = \sum_j c_j \phi_j(x) \) is the desired result, determining the coefficients \( \{c_j\} \) without constructing the Vandermonde matrix can be cumbersome:

#### (a) **Basis Function Coupling**
- In general, the values of the function at the nodes \( f_i \) do not directly correspond to the coefficients \( c_j \), unless the basis functions are specially chosen (e.g., orthogonal basis on specific points).
- For arbitrary bases, the relationship between \( f_i \) and \( c_j \) must be computed, which is what the Vandermonde matrix encapsulates.

#### (b) **Non-Orthogonal Bases**
- If the basis \( \{\phi_j(x)\} \) is not orthogonal, the coefficients \( c_j \) are not directly proportional to the function values at the nodes. The Vandermonde matrix accounts for the interactions between basis functions at different nodes.

#### (c) **Numerical Stability**
- Constructing and solving the Vandermonde matrix, especially with well-chosen points (e.g., Chebyshev or Gauss points), ensures numerical stability. Direct manipulation of basis functions can lead to instabilities due to ill-conditioning or overlapping basis effects.

---

### **4. Practical Use of the Vandermonde Matrix**

In practice:
1. For **monomial bases** (e.g., \( \phi_j(x) = x^j \)):
   - The Vandermonde matrix is explicitly:
     \[
     V_{ij} = x_i^j,
     \]
     and is typically ill-conditioned for large \( N \) or unevenly spaced points \( \{x_i\} \).

2. For **Lagrange basis functions**:
   - The Vandermonde matrix becomes a diagonal matrix in barycentric form because \( \psi_j(x_i) = \delta_{ij} \), simplifying computations.

3. For **orthogonal polynomial bases**:
   - The Vandermonde matrix is well-conditioned for certain quadrature points (e.g., Gauss-Lobatto or Chebyshev nodes).

---

### **Summary**
The Vandermonde matrix is used in interpolation because it provides:
- A systematic way to compute coefficients in any polynomial basis.
- A framework for converting between nodal values and polynomial coefficients.
- A numerically stable and flexible approach, especially for arbitrary bases.

While it’s theoretically possible to skip the Vandermonde matrix by directly summing coefficients and basis functions, this is often impractical and inefficient in cases where the basis functions overlap or when working with general nodal values.

============================================
Is projection deemed unnecessary when using persson artificial viscosity or does persson use project or pther special techniques to interpolate the flux to each side of an element interface in conjunction with the artificial viscosity method?
============================================

Projection is not deemed unnecessary when using **Persson's artificial viscosity**; in fact, it plays a key role in stabilizing the solution. While the artificial viscosity method itself introduces a localized dissipation to handle discontinuities and steep gradients, projection or careful flux interpolation is still required to stabilize the solution at element interfaces in **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods**. Here’s how projection and interpolation interact with Persson's approach:

---

### **1. The Role of Artificial Viscosity in DG Methods**
**Persson’s artificial viscosity**:
- Adds a dissipation term to the governing equations, dynamically increasing viscosity near shocks or steep gradients while leaving smooth regions unaffected.
- The artificial viscosity is introduced in the form:
  \[
  \nabla \cdot (\mu \nabla u),
  \]
  where \(\mu\) is the artificial viscosity coefficient, typically computed using a **spectral smoothness indicator** based on the decay of high-order modal coefficients.

However, artificial viscosity does not directly resolve the issue of how to interpolate fluxes across element interfaces. Without proper stabilization, oscillations at interfaces can still occur, especially in **high-order DG methods**.

---

### **2. Interpolation of Fluxes to Interfaces**
Flux interpolation to the interfaces is critical for DG methods, as the numerical fluxes define the exchange of information between elements. The challenges arise from:
- Discontinuities in the solution (especially near shocks).
- High-order polynomial representations, which can oscillate at element boundaries.

#### **Does Persson's Method Eliminate the Need for Projection?**
No. Persson's method addresses the **smoothness of the solution within elements** but does not inherently solve the interpolation problem at interfaces. To compute stable and accurate fluxes at the element boundaries, additional techniques like **projection** or **specialized flux treatments** are still required.

#### **Why Projection May Still Be Used**
Projection smooths or stabilizes the high-order polynomial representation of the flux within each element, particularly when:
- The polynomial representation oscillates excessively near discontinuities.
- The flux needs to be represented in a consistent and stable manner at the interface.

---

### **3. Techniques Used Alongside Persson’s Method for Flux Interpolation**

Persson's artificial viscosity is often combined with other techniques to handle flux interpolation at element interfaces effectively:

#### (a) **Projection onto Lower-Order Spaces**
- A common approach is to **project the solution or flux onto a lower-order space** before computing the numerical flux at the interface.
- This ensures that the interpolated flux is less prone to oscillations, particularly in regions of high gradients.

#### (b) **Riemann Solvers**
- Numerical fluxes are typically computed using **Riemann solvers** (e.g., Roe, HLL, or Lax-Friedrichs solvers). These solvers inherently stabilize the flux by introducing dissipation at the interface.
- Persson's method complements Riemann solvers by smoothing the solution within elements.

#### (c) **Artificial Viscosity Regularization**
- The artificial viscosity term modifies the solution, reducing high-order oscillations that would otherwise complicate flux interpolation.
- In some implementations, **interface fluxes are recomputed after applying the viscosity**, ensuring consistency.

#### (d) **Shock Sensors and Adaptive Treatments**
- Persson's spectral indicator can be used not only to compute viscosity but also to detect regions requiring special flux treatments (e.g., hybrid DG-finite volume methods).

#### (e) **Face-Averaged Fluxes**
- Instead of directly interpolating the high-order flux to the interface, compute **face-averaged fluxes** using numerical quadrature:
  \[
  \bar{f} = \frac{1}{|S|} \int_S f(x) \, dS,
  \]
  where \( S \) is the interface face.
- This reduces oscillations while maintaining accuracy.

#### (f) **Filtering**
- High-order modes of the solution can be selectively filtered near interfaces, ensuring that the flux remains stable. This is often done in conjunction with artificial viscosity.

---

### **4. Best Practices in Implementations**
When using Persson's artificial viscosity, a typical workflow might involve:
1. **Smoothness Detection**: Use the spectral smoothness indicator to compute \(\mu\) for artificial viscosity.
2. **Artificial Viscosity Application**: Modify the governing equations with the viscosity term, ensuring stabilization within elements.
3. **Flux Interpolation**:
   - Use **projection** to stabilize the flux representation, especially for high-order solutions.
   - Compute **numerical fluxes** using robust Riemann solvers.
   - Optionally apply **face averaging** or **hybrid methods** to reduce oscillations at interfaces.

---

### **5. Why Combine Artificial Viscosity and Projection?**
- **Artificial viscosity** handles smoothness within elements but does not directly address interface oscillations.
- **Projection or stabilized interpolation** ensures that fluxes at element interfaces are computed in a consistent and oscillation-free manner.
- The two techniques complement each other to achieve robust shock-capturing and stable DG solutions.

---

### **Conclusion**
Projection (or related flux interpolation techniques) is not eliminated by using Persson's artificial viscosity. Instead, projection often works **in conjunction** with artificial viscosity to stabilize flux computations at element interfaces. This combination ensures smooth solutions within elements and robust, oscillation-free fluxes across interfaces, which is essential for high-order DG methods applied to problems with discontinuities.
