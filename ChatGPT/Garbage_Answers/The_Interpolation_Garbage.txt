Note that the interior and edge nodes in this basis construction are completely distinct.
They are effectively separate matrices, and so have zero coupling. ChatGPT confidently
made assertions that the edge and interior should be kept distinct with arguments about
edges only having "edge support", etc, and convinced itself that the basis shouldn't interact.

Utter garbage - worth looking at to know how it can go astray.
