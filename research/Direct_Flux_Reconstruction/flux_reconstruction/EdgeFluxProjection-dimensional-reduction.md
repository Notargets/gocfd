Letâ€™s consider the RT1 example: three interior points map to each edge with two nodes. Three parametrized values transfer via the orthogonal projection to three points along the tangent line of one edge. I now want to obtain the values of the existing 1D polynomial basis that best fit these three point values using least squares - how do I form the matrix problem and solution given my current Vandermonde matrix for the edge polynomial?

Given your RT1 element, you have:

- Three interior points that project orthogonally onto an edge.
- A 1D polynomial basis on the edge (formed using Jacobi polynomials).
- An inverse Vandermonde matrix that maps nodal values to polynomial coefficients.

Your goal is to fit the three projected values using the 1D edge basis in a least-squares sense.

### **Step 1: Define the System**

You are given three projected values $$U_i$$ (from the RT interior) at locations $$s_0^i$$ along the edge. The best-fit function in your edge polynomial basis (which consists of two nodes for RT1) is:

$$
U_{\text{edge}}(s_0) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} c_k P_k(s_0)
$$

where $$P_k(s_0)$$ are the 1D Jacobi basis polynomials and $$c_k$$ are the coefficients we seek.

To solve this, we minimize the least-squares error:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{3} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{N} c_k P_k(s_0^i) - U_i \right)^2.
$$

This results in a linear system:

$$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{b}
$$

where:

- $$A_{ik} = P_k(s_0^i)$$ (evaluation of basis polynomials at the projected locations).
- $$c_k$$ are the unknown coefficients.
- $$b_i = U_i$$ (values projected from the interior).

### **Step 2: Construct the Matrix System**

Given:

- Three projected values:

  $$
  \mathbf{U} = \begin{bmatrix} U_1 \\ U_2 \\ U_3 \end{bmatrix}
  $$

- A 1D basis with two functions $$P_0(s_0), P_1(s_0)$$ (since RT1 edges have two nodes).
- Three sampling locations $$s_0^i$$ along the edge.

The least-squares matrix is:

$$
\mathbf{A} =
\begin{bmatrix}
P_0(s_0^1) & P_1(s_0^1) \\
P_0(s_0^2) & P_1(s_0^2) \\
P_0(s_0^3) & P_1(s_0^3)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and the right-hand side is:

$$
\mathbf{b} =
\begin{bmatrix} U_1 \\ U_2 \\ U_3 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

The least-squares solution is:

$$
\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A})^{-1} \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{b}.
$$

This provides the best-fit coefficients $$c_k$$ in the Jacobi polynomial basis.

### **Step 3: Use the Vandermonde Matrix for Nodal Values**

Since you already have the **Vandermonde matrix** $$\mathbf{V}$$ for the edge, which relates **nodal values to Jacobi coefficients**, we can compute the **nodal values** $$U_{\text{edge, nodes}}$$ from the fitted coefficients.

Using:

$$
U_{\text{edge, nodes}} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{c}
$$

you obtain the **edge nodal values** needed for flux calculations.

### **Final Steps for Implementation**
1. Compute the basis values $$P_k(s_0^i)$$ at the three projected locations.
2. Assemble the least-squares matrix $$\mathbf{A}$$ and RHS $$\mathbf{b}$$.
3. Solve for the best-fit coefficients:

   $$
   \mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A})^{-1} \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{b}
   $$

4. Convert to nodal values using the edge **Vandermonde matrix**:

   $$
   U_{\text{edge, nodes}} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{c}.
   $$

### Projection of values from Interior nodes to parameterized edge

A **convenient expression** for projecting values from **(r, s) space** to a **tangential parameter $$ s' $$** along an edge originating at $$ (r_0, s_0) $$ can be derived as follows:

### **General Form for Projection to a Tangential Parameter $$ s' $$**

Given:
- A reference point $$ (r_0, s_0) $$ on the edge.
- A **tangential direction vector** $$ \mathbf{t} = (t_r, t_s) $$, which is the **unit tangent** along the edge.
- A general interior point $$ (r, s) $$.

We define the **tangential projection** as:

$$
s' = (r - r_0) t_r + (s - s_0) t_s
$$

where:
- $$ s' $$ is the **scalar parameter** measuring displacement **along the edge tangent** starting from $$ (r_0, s_0) $$.
- $$ \mathbf{t} = (t_r, t_s) $$ is the **unit tangent vector** of the edge.

### **Alternative Expression Using a Normalized Tangent**

If the edge is parameterized by an arc-length parameterization, we can normalize $$ s' $$ so that it lies in a canonical range (e.g., $$ [-1,1] $$) by dividing by the edge length $$ L $$:

$$
s' = \frac{(r - r_0) t_r + (s - s_0) t_s}{L}
$$

where:

$$
L = \sqrt{(r_1 - r_0)^2 + (s_1 - s_0)^2}
$$

for an edge between endpoints $$ (r_0, s_0) $$ and $$ (r_1, s_1) $$.
